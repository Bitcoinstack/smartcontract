# BitcoinStack Stake & Yield Protocol

## Overview
BitcoinStack is a Layer 2-optimized Bitcoin DeFi platform that enables traders and holders to seamlessly stake their BTC across top Layer 2 networks‚Äî**Rootstock**, **Lightning**, and **Liquid**‚Äîand earn compounding yields, all managed through one unified protocol.

## Smart Contract: BitcoinStakeYieldProtocol

This smart contract serves as the core of our yield-generating protocol. Designed to operate on Rootstock (RSK), it enables:

- **Cross-Layer Staking**: Stake BTC using bridges for Layer 2 networks.
- **Seamless Yield Accumulation**: Automatically calculates yield based on real-time staking duration.
- **Real-Time Switching**: Future-ready integration to allow dynamic switching between Layer 2s.
- **Quantum-Safe Future**: Built to incorporate upgrades to post-quantum encryption and zk-proofs.

## Features

### üîó Layer 2 Integration
Supports BTC staking through smart bridges into:
- Lightning Network (via HTLC-based bridge)
- Rootstock (rBTC staking)
- Liquid Network (via federated bridge wrappers)

### üíπ Yield Engine
- Compounds yield based on staking time and real-time interest rate.
- Users can claim earned yield at any time.

### üõ°Ô∏è Modular Bridge Support
Each bridge contract follows the `ILayerBridge` interface, making it pluggable for new Layer 2s in the future.

## Functionality

1. **Stake BTC** via preferred Layer 2.
2. **Accrue Yield** based on stake amount and duration.
3. **Unstake BTC** anytime with yield included.
4. **Claim Rewards** to withdraw yield in the form of rBTC or tokens.


- **First-of-its-kind** BTC staking with unified Layer 2 interface.
- **Real DeFi Utility** for Bitcoin holders using existing Layer 2 infra.
- **Modular + Scalable** architecture, ready for Taproot Assets, zk-rollups, and Ordinals Layer.
- **Security Focused** with future ZKP upgrades and post-quantum planning.

## Future Development

- Integration with Lightning-native yield pools.
- Support for Liquid-native tokenized bonds.
- Fully automated APY optimization logic using ML.

- # exSat Hybrid Consensus Protocol (PoW + PoS) for Bitcoin Fork

## Overview

**exSat** is a Bitcoin-based fork that extends core Bitcoin functionality by implementing a **Hybrid Consensus Mechanism (PoW + PoS)** and introducing native **metadata extensions**. It modernizes Bitcoin by enabling smart tagging, identity, and programmable logic‚Äîwhile preserving decentralized security through a dual-consensus model.

## Why Hybrid Consensus?

Bitcoin‚Äôs PoW ensures robust decentralization and security. However, it suffers from high energy consumption and long confirmation times. By integrating **Proof of Stake**, exSat allows faster and more sustainable block confirmations while maintaining trust through interleaved PoW mining.

**Hybrid Benefits:**
- **PoW** ensures trustless computation and miner participation.
- **PoS** rewards long-term holders and encourages decentralization.
- **Hybrid Governance** allows dynamic protocol upgrades without centralized control.

## Features

- üîÅ **Hybrid Consensus Validation**: At least 50% PoW + 30% PoS blocks to maintain chain validity.
- üßæ **exSat Metadata**: Every block supports extensible metadata (e.g., identity tags, token info).
- üí† **Stake Simulation**: Users can stake and validate PoS blocks.
- ‚ö° **Efficient Block Time**: Hybrid block scheduling improves network responsiveness.

## Code Functionality

- Simulates block creation using PoW and PoS.
- Validates blocks against hybrid ratio logic.
- Integrates block metadata (e.g., custom tags, off-chain pointers).
- Designed to fork from Bitcoin but adaptable for RSK or Taproot Assets.

## Future Development

- zkSNARK metadata proof layer.
- Taproot-enhanced scripting for native contracts.
- Lightning + PoS reward bonding mechanism.

## Getting Started

```bash
g++ -o exSatHybrid exSatHybridConsensus.cpp
./exSatHybrid
