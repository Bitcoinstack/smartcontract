# BitcoinStack Stake & Yield Protocol

## Overview
BitcoinStack is a Layer 2-optimized Bitcoin DeFi platform that enables traders and holders to seamlessly stake their BTC across top Layer 2 networks‚Äî**Rootstock**, **Lightning**, and **Liquid**‚Äîand earn compounding yields, all managed through one unified protocol.

## Smart Contract: BitcoinStakeYieldProtocol

This smart contract serves as the core of our yield-generating protocol. Designed to operate on Rootstock (RSK), it enables:

- **Cross-Layer Staking**: Stake BTC using bridges for Layer 2 networks.
- **Seamless Yield Accumulation**: Automatically calculates yield based on real-time staking duration.
- **Real-Time Switching**: Future-ready integration to allow dynamic switching between Layer 2s.
- **Quantum-Safe Future**: Built to incorporate upgrades to post-quantum encryption and zk-proofs.



# BitcoinStack Smart Contracts on Stacks

This repository contains Clarity smart contracts that power the BitcoinStack Layer 2 Aggregation and Yield Optimization platform, using the Stacks blockchain and sBTC for gas transactions.

## Contracts

### 1. `cross_chain_swap.clar`
Enables atomic swaps between Stacks and other Bitcoin Layer 2s like Rootstock, Liquid, and Lightning using HTLC logic.

### 2. `cross_chain_messaging.clar`
Handles cross-chain event emission and message relay through off-chain relayers.

### 3. `btc_cross_chain_bridge.clar`
Implements a basic lock/unlock BTC bridge logic for cross-network transfers.

### 4. `multi_chain_stake_yield.clar`
Allows users to stake BTC and earn aggregated yields from cross-chain DeFi protocols. Rewards are calculated block-by-block and can be claimed anytime.

## Technologies Used

- Clarity Smart Contracts
- Stacks Blockchain
- sBTC for gas
- Multi-chain Layer 2 aggregation logic

## Next Steps

- Integrate off-chain relayers and oracles
- Support zk-proofs and quantum-safe staking
- Enhance UI wallet support for sBTC operations

- # exSat Hybrid Consensus Protocol (PoW + PoS) for Bitcoin Fork

## Overview

**exSat** is a Bitcoin-based fork that extends core Bitcoin functionality by implementing a **Hybrid Consensus Mechanism (PoW + PoS)** and introducing native **metadata extensions**. It modernizes Bitcoin by enabling smart tagging, identity, and programmable logic‚Äîwhile preserving decentralized security through a dual-consensus model.

## Why Hybrid Consensus?

Bitcoin‚Äôs PoW ensures robust decentralization and security. However, it suffers from high energy consumption and long confirmation times. By integrating **Proof of Stake**, exSat allows faster and more sustainable block confirmations while maintaining trust through interleaved PoW mining.

**Hybrid Benefits:**
- **PoW** ensures trustless computation and miner participation.
- **PoS** rewards long-term holders and encourages decentralization.
- **Hybrid Governance** allows dynamic protocol upgrades without centralized control.

## Features

- üîÅ **Hybrid Consensus Validation**: At least 50% PoW + 30% PoS blocks to maintain chain validity.
- üßæ **exSat Metadata**: Every block supports extensible metadata (e.g., identity tags, token info).
- üí† **Stake Simulation**: Users can stake and validate PoS blocks.
- ‚ö° **Efficient Block Time**: Hybrid block scheduling improves network responsiveness.

## Code Functionality

- Simulates block creation using PoW and PoS.
- Validates blocks against hybrid ratio logic.
- Integrates block metadata (e.g., custom tags, off-chain pointers).
- Designed to fork from Bitcoin but adaptable for RSK or Taproot Assets.

## Future Development

- zkSNARK metadata proof layer.
- Taproot-enhanced scripting for native contracts.
- Lightning + PoS reward bonding mechanism.

## Getting Started

```bash
g++ -o exSatHybrid exSatHybridConsensus.cpp
./exSatHybrid
